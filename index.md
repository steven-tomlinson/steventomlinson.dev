## What I Do

I design software systems that survive scale, complexity, and time.

With more than 30 years of hands-on experience, I work as a **senior software solution architect**, helping organizations design, modernize, and integrate systems across enterprise and emerging platforms.

My work sits at the intersection of **identity, distributed systems, and application architecture**, bridging established Microsoft and Linux ecosystems with modern cloud-native and decentralized infrastructure.

I specialize in turning ambiguity into structure — and complexity into systems teams can actually operate.

---

## Architectural Focus

Rather than chasing novelty, I focus on architectural decisions that hold up under real-world pressure:

* Identity-centric system design and access boundaries
* Distributed and protocol-driven architectures
* Secure integration of legacy and modern platforms
* Long-lived systems designed for evolution, not rewrites
* Developer experience as an architectural concern

I believe good architecture is defined as much by what it *constrains* as by what it enables.

---

## Selected Work & Reference Architectures

My public work emphasizes **architectural patterns and reference implementations**, not one-off demos.

Examples include:

* Identity-aware ASP.NET application architectures integrating Microsoft Identity with decentralized trust models
* Reusable Razor component frameworks that surface protocol-level concerns without leaking complexity into business logic
* Secure, composable building blocks for teams exploring blockchain-backed workflows responsibly

These projects are documented and maintained on GitHub as **living architectural references**.

---

## How I Work

I approach architecture as a process of **clarifying constraints**:

* What must not fail
* What must scale
* What must remain flexible over time

My role is to help teams make these decisions early — and live with them comfortably years later.
