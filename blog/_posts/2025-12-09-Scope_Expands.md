Still working on the original core concept, had to expand scope of deliverables ater initial R&D and MVP testing. I realized that in order to actually deliver a useful application to serve a regulated market, the scope of the applicaiton's functionality had to expand. 



The application now includes support for "Bring Your Own Storage" to support centralized (GDrive, Onedrive, DropBox and decentralized use-case like IPFS and working on ARWeavea dn others.

I have implemented  a more abstracted or Web2-like UI/UX for operations like User Authentication, Role-based access using OAuth and JWT by integrating Stellar   cryptographic keypair management and UI/UX abstractions for invoice processing and payment approval, cryptographic and MFA keypair-signature capture, and disbursement operations. 

These added requirements lead to the proposal and awards to develop the Stellar Identity Framework project and the Stellar Razor and Blazor Component Library project.

Additionally, I also developed the SDEX Razor Component Library project to round out the suite. 

This work lead to the development and publication of the Lockb0x Protocol and IETF Draft for a standards-based framework for creating  “Codex Entries” — machine-readable “Controllable Electronic Records” as defined under UCC Articles 12, 9, 8, and 1 as revised in 2022.

In an attempt to improve basic engagement during development and testing, as well as suss-out the implementation of a "white-label" service, I have added a gamified landing page that uses Pakana's Work Order Management features to send players on quests or real-world missions to earn NFTs and other rewards.

This is in an experimental Web3 experience named Node_Zero that is.a anchored at the Lamina1 network, a metaverse experiment by the author Neal S.Stephenson. Where I am am also an official creator and ambassador.
