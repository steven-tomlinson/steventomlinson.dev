# 🕰️ Metaverse Standard Time: A Temporal Framework for the Open Metaverse

In the physical world, time is fragmented—divided by zones and distorted by daylight saving.
In the metaverse, such fragmentation becomes a liability.

**Metaverse Standard Time (MST)** proposes a unified temporal layer for persistent, interoperable, creator-driven worlds—aligned with Neal Stephenson’s metaverse vision and Lamina1’s mission.

## Core Principles
- **Universal** (single reference, no DST)
- **Persistent** (reliable logging and governance)
- **Creator-centric** (simplifies scheduling across platforms)
- **Interoperable** (open-standards friendly)
