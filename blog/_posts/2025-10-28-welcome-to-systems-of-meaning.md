**Systems of Meaning** is my consolidated blog where code, story, and independence meet.

- **Code:** posts on verifiable systems, identity, and decentralized infra  
- **World:** transmissions from the Node_Zero / Whispering Code universe  
- **Self:** notes on focus, craft, and staying small with intent

Expect one post per week, rotating pillars, plus occasional hybrid essays.
