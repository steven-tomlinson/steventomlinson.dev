<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>I am a <strong>senior software solution architect</strong> with more than <strong>30 years of professional experience</strong> designing, building, modernizing, and operating complex software systems.</p>

<p>My career spans enterprise platforms, developer tooling, distributed systems, data-intensive applications, and emerging decentralized infrastructure. I have worked across <strong>Microsoft and Linux ecosystems</strong>, from early client/server architectures through modern cloud-native and protocol-driven systems.</p>

<p>What distinguishes my work is not familiarity with tools, but <strong>architectural judgment</strong> — knowing which decisions matter, when they matter, and how long teams will live with them.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-i-do">What I Do</h2>

<p>I help organizations design systems that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remain understandable as they scale</li>
  <li>Survive personnel and technology change</li>
  <li>Integrate legacy and modern platforms safely</li>
  <li>Treat identity, data, and trust as first-class concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>My role often sits between engineering leadership, security, and delivery teams — translating business ambiguity into technical structure that engineers can execute without constant re-interpretation.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="architectural-domains">Architectural Domains</h2>

<p>Over the course of my career, I have designed and delivered systems across:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Enterprise application architecture</strong> (ASP.NET, distributed services, integration layers)</li>
  <li><strong>Identity and access management</strong> (authentication, authorization, trust boundaries)</li>
  <li><strong>Data-centric systems</strong> (relational, document, event-driven)</li>
  <li><strong>Developer platforms and reusable frameworks</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid and distributed architectures</strong>, including protocol- and blockchain-backed systems</li>
  <li><strong>Modernization initiatives</strong> spanning decades-old systems and contemporary platforms</li>
</ul>

<p>I am equally comfortable working at whiteboard, codebase, and operational levels — and I expect architectures to survive contact with reality.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ai--emerging-technologies">AI &amp; Emerging Technologies</h2>

<p>My recent focus includes the architectural implications of generative AI, agent-based systems, and decentralized infrastructure.</p>

<p>I approach these domains not as consumer tools, but as <strong>architectural forces</strong> that alter system boundaries, governance models, and long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>Key areas of active work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Agent Systems</strong> — Understanding how generative and agent-based AI reshapes system design, operational boundaries, and organizational governance</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized Finance &amp; Protocol Infrastructure</strong> — Developing architectural fluency in trust models, financial primitives, and enterprise integration patterns</li>
  <li><strong>AI Portfolio &amp; Research</strong> — Maintaining an <a href="https://github.com/steven-tomlinson/ai-portfolio">active portfolio</a> of certification labs, experiments, and reference implementations</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol Engineering</strong> — Building secure, verifiable systems including the <a href="https://github.com/steven-tomlinson/lockbox-codex-forge">Lockb0x Codex Forge</a> Chrome extension for digital provenance</li>
</ul>

<p>These efforts are documented through formal certifications from Google Cloud and Duke University, and are applied to practical system implementations — not just theoretical exploration.</p>

<p>For detailed information on certifications and coursework, see my <a href="/continuing-education.html">Continuing Education</a> page.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="architectural-philosophy">Architectural Philosophy</h2>

<p>I do not treat architecture as diagrams or abstractions.
I treat it as <strong>decision-making under constraint</strong>.</p>

<p>Good architecture answers hard questions early:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What <strong>must not fail</strong></li>
  <li>What <strong>must scale</strong></li>
  <li>What <strong>must remain flexible over time</strong></li>
  <li>What can be allowed to change — and what cannot</li>
</ul>

<p>My approach favors explicit boundaries, predictable failure modes, and systems that can evolve without rewrites.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="public-work--reference-implementations">Public Work &amp; Reference Implementations</h2>

<p>My public repositories and projects are intentionally <strong>architectural in nature</strong>.</p>

<p>They emphasize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reference architectures over demos</li>
  <li>Reusable system components over one-off solutions</li>
  <li>Explicit handling of identity, trust, and integration boundaries</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identity-aware ASP.NET application frameworks</li>
  <li>Reusable Razor component systems</li>
  <li>Composable infrastructure exploring decentralized workflows responsibly</li>
  <li><strong>AI Portfolio</strong> — Certification labs and research implementations demonstrating agent-based systems, Azure AI integration, and architectural patterns</li>
  <li><strong>Lockb0x Codex Forge</strong> — Protocol-driven Chrome extension for secure, verifiable digital provenance with cryptographic proofs</li>
</ul>

<p>These projects are maintained as <strong>living examples</strong>, not static showcases.</p>

<p>For detailed information on AI-related projects, see my <a href="/ai-projects.html">AI Projects &amp; Research</a> page.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-i-work">How I Work</h2>

<p>I work best with teams facing complexity, scale, or long-term responsibility.</p>

<p>My contribution is rarely just code — it is helping teams understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which problems are real</li>
  <li>Which problems are premature</li>
  <li>Which problems are inevitable</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is not architectural purity, but <strong>systems teams can live with for years</strong>.</p>
