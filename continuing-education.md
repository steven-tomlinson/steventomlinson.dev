## Continuing Education

Ongoing education is a professional obligation, not a career reset.

My continuing education focuses on **emerging system forces** — artificial intelligence, decentralized finance, and protocol-driven infrastructure — and how they intersect with enterprise architecture, governance, and long-lived systems.

Rather than chasing tools, I prioritize **foundational understanding**, **organizational impact**, and **architectural risk awareness**.

---

## Focus Areas

### Artificial Intelligence & Agent Systems

Understanding how generative and agent-based AI alters system design, operational boundaries, and governance.

### Decentralized Finance & Protocol Infrastructure

Developing architectural fluency in decentralized systems, trust models, and financial primitives — with attention to where these systems integrate cleanly with enterprise environments, and where they do not.

### Cloud & Platform Evolution

Tracking how cloud-native platforms evolve to support intelligent agents, data-intensive workflows, and policy-driven systems.

## Certifications & Specializations

### Generative AI Leader

**Provider:** Google Cloud
**Year:** 2025

## Perspective

Senior architects are not paid to know *everything*.
They are paid to recognize **what matters**, **what is premature**, and **what carries long-term risk**.

My continuing education exists to sharpen that judgment.
